# About

Hi, I am Mirav (pronounced *mee-ruh-av*)

I helm two hats as Engineering manager / Technical product manager at a HealthTech Stealth Startup. Currently
building Data lakes, Knowledge graphs consisting of ~800 million nodes, relationships, data points 
for accurate search and insightful analytics.

By night, I kung-fu, building microservices, platform infrastructure (_mostly_ [Go](https://go.dev/)).
When I'm not conquering the tech world, you'll find me on the badminton court or football pitch,
shaking up [Hendricks gin](https://www.hendricksgin.com/)
for friends and family, planning for un-planned road trips. <br>
And yes, spill some digital ink [here](blog/index.md).
