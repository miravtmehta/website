# About

Hi, I am Mirav (pronounced *mee-ruh-av*)

I currently work as an Engineering Manager / Technical Product Manager at a HealthTech Stealth Startup. I’m building
Data
Lakes, Knowledge Management Systems, and assisting LLM models for precision search and decision-making, serving
large audience of Research institutions, Bio-Tech heads, and Public cloud providers.

By night, I kung-fu, building
microservices, messaging service (*Python, mostly [Go](https://go.dev/)*) and tickle
around [CNCF](https://landscape.cncf.io/) landscape.
When I'm not
conquering the tech world, I play badminton and football (noob master), go un-planned long drives, shake
up [Hendricks gin](https://www.hendricksgin.com/) for friends and family, as well spill some digital
ink [here](blog/index.md).
