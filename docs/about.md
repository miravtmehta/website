# About

Hi, I am Mirav (pronounced _mee-ruh-av_)

I helm two hats as Lead Software Engineer / Technical product manager at a HealthTech Stealth Startup. Currently
building Data lakes, Knowledge graphs consisting of ~2 million nodes, relationships, data points combined
for accurate search and insightful analytics powered by semantic web (web 3.0). It also extends to network
infrastructure and security

By night, I kung-fu, building microservices, platform infrastructure (_mostly_ [Go](https://go.dev/)),
and read around technical blogs and product offerings.
When I'm not conquering the tech world, you'll find me on the badminton court or football pitch,
shaking up [Hendricks gin](https://www.hendricksgin.com/)
for friends and family, unplanned long drives, hiking. And yes, spill some digital ink [here](blog/index.md).

Please feel free to stay in touch questions, updates, `work opportunities`. I'm available through these channels:
