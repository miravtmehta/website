# About

Hi, I am Mirav (pronounced *mee-ruh-av*)

I currently work as a Technical Product Manager / Engineering Manager at a HealthTech Stealth Startup, building Data
Lakes, Knowledge Management Systems, and LLM models for precision search and analysis serving a large audience of
biomedical institutions, research heads, and healthcare cloud providers.

By day, I manage talented BE and FE engineers, guiding them to bring our vision to life. By night, I kung-fu, building
microservices, automating Infra provisioning (*Python, mostly [Go](https://go.dev/)*) and ML pipelines for personal projects. When I'm not
conquering the tech world, I smash badminton and football (noob master), shake
up [Hendricks gin](https://www.hendricksgin.com/) for friends and family, and spill some digital
ink [here](blog/index.md).
