# No one gives a dang about your blog ! 
<!-- more -->

I started writing blogs on Engineering, Products, Leadership and Mathematics back in 2015 on WordPress. I possibly wrote a few articles sharing my thoughts and learnings about these topics. The frequency of my publishing was as rare as February 29th, occurring once every leap years.

I had numerous reasons to STOP writing about this jibber jabber, and eventually i did stop for sometime. Here are the reasons why "No one gives a damn about your blog":

1. You aren't a Ph.D. in your field, and your expertise may be somewhat limited and half cooked
2. You're not a renowned person whose writings are taken seriously by the public
3. People might have come across better blogs that are visually appealing and offer more value than your modest webpage filled with jargon
4. You haven't appeared in any CNBC, CNN interviews, or any of the top 10 public shows to establish your credibility as a writer

Do they, look like they care? - Hell, No !

One should not give a damn about what others think of them. Trust me; they have other things to think about and take care off. Here are good reasons why you should care about writing your blog:

1. It helps you streamline your thought process in plain, simple language, rather than having bursts of multiple imaginations that brings chaos to your toy brain.
2. It serves as a digital diary for your future self. This allows you to compare how blunt your thoughts were when your "future you" reads later. 
    
    — I still remember my Facebook pick-up line messages that I sent to hot chicks back in college days. I just wish luck to my brain-dead cells back then; it was Stupid! It essentially brings to joy and memories to its best. In the end, *that’s all it matters right ?*
    
3. It enables you to translate the complexity and fiction of your imaginative mind into words in the real world. I think it does help bring clarity and scarps of imaginary intuitions which ain’t exists at first place in real
4. Unintentionally, it helps people who are on the same path and can relate to the journey you've undertaken in the past. You never know it might help, take a step back and retrospect and maybe if karma is good, then  thank you later !
5. It gives you the ability to add your perspective to an original process, field, or content; and sometimes, that's all that matters. By adding your perspective, you stand out as “opinionated” which is good, better off than a common flock of quaking ducks 
6. You can express whatever you want because "ONLY you should give a damn about your blog!"

Who is going to waste their time reading this crap?” But you know what? I just don't care about what people think. Here's my post, and one can't do anything about it :)
