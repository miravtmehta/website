# Mastering the Art of Value-Based Pricing

<!-- more -->

Let‚Äôs say [Boat](https://www.decathlon.in/) starts selling its wireless headphone at **$720** ( ~‚Çπ60K), would you buy it ?

*‚Äî I doubt, one might at this point of time.‚Ä¶*

Hypothetically, what if [Bose](https://www.bose.com/home) sells at same price point ?

*‚Äî Most likely, people might ‚Ä¶ a little hesitant, but still‚Ä¶.*

How do you know if your customers want to pin their money that‚Äôs priced at **$720** These pricing numbers can have
emotional meanings associated with them. Could be

---

1. Way **too cheap** ‚Äî Just take my money !
2. **Cheap**‚Äî Bang for the buck
3. Hmm,**getting expensive**‚Äî Ahh ... ain‚Äôt bad deal ?
4. **Too expensive**‚Äî Out of my league

Customers are price sensitive ! Somehow instincts is wired to flash the image of brand first, and then ‚Ä¶. the price that
comes with it.

$$
Emotion \propto perceived \hspace{0.1cm}value
$$

How do you know the perceived value for product/service that customers are willing is fair price to pay for ? ‚Äî PSM it
is.

**PSM** **(Price Sensitivity Meter)** : probably one of the finest marketing technique for determining consumer price
preferences; essentially **helps determine psychologically acceptable range of price that customers are willing to pay !
**

### When to use it ?

1. Assess what price range the market considers to be fair for your product
2. Need quick and quantitive results

# **How do i model this Price Meter ..thing ?**

## Step 1: Build the questionnaire

[Van Westendorp‚Äôs Price Sensitivity Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter) is
one of a number of *** direct *** techniques to research pricing. Direct techniques assume that people have some
understanding of what a product or service is worth, and therefore that it makes sense to ask explicitly about price.

The 3  *** direct ***  pricing research methods are these

The main direct pricing research methods are these : (Less ‚Üí Highly recommended in order)

1. **Laddering** - ‚Äú*Would you buy at* **$**720 ?‚Äù*,* then‚Äù*would you buy at* **$**950?‚Äù*or‚Äùwould you still buy
   at* **$ *** 720 ?‚Äù*

    <aside>
    üí° This approach brings scepticism,  these questions are often sensed as negotiations strategy than pinning the price customers wants to pay

    </aside>


2. **Direct open-ended questioning** - ‚Äú*How much would you pay for this ?*‚Äù

<aside>
üí° Bad way to ask, might not help on why X amount was said , puts on ambiguity if looked at quantity way. Might help with if further interviews at done to understand the perceived value seen by customers on why X value was assigned

</aside>

1. **Monadic** - ‚Äú*Would you be willing to buy at* **$720** *?‚Äù*

    <aside>
    üí° This strategy lets you pull exact data points from multiple customers, helping you aggregative leaning curve , problem is customer may not perceive this worth **$72**0; hence a pre-survey would be helpful to narrow down range of prices customers wants to pay to. Would be nice to have a open-ended question with an option to comment to check if above pricing is a blunder

## Step 2:  Aggregate the data

The collected data from survey form would look in given table below

| Respondents | Too Cheap | Cheap | Getting Expensive | Too Expensive | Data Validity |
|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1           | 300       | 400   | 500               | 900           | valid         |
| 2           | 300       | 300   | 550               | 800           | valid         |
| 3           | 100       | 200   | 1000              | 800           | In-valid      |
| 4           | 200       | 400   | 700               | 950           | valid         |
| 5           | 200       | 500   | 650               | 1000          | valid         |
| 6           | 300       | 400   | 500               | 900           | valid         |
| 7           | 300       | 300   | 550               | 800           | valid         |
| 8           | 450       | 500   | 700               | 950           | valid         |
| 9           | 250       | 400   | 700               | 950           | valid         |
| 10          | 300       | 550   | 650               | 1000          | valid         |
| 11          | 100       | 200   | 500               | 900           | valid         |
| 12          | 300       | 350   | 550               | 800           | valid         |
| 13          | 100       | 200   | 1000              | 800           | In-valid      |
| 14          | 200       | 450   | 700               | 950           | valid         |
| 15          | 400       | 500   | 650               | 1000          | valid         |

Respondents data is valid **ONLY** If :

```jsx
IF(Too cheap <= Bargain <= Getting Expensive <= Too Expensive)
```

**In-valid** data means customers have not understood the questionnaire or have limited knowledge on the product space
to assign the appropriate value. I think it would be safe to say to scrap off in-valid data off while calculating,
possibly surveyor was ‚Äú*as drunk as a skunk*‚Äù while acknowledging survey

## Step 3: Making sense out of  *** *Van Westendorp graph *** *

Once you‚Äôve collected data as part of step 2, i recommend using any of these 2 tools, to spawn the graph, ‚Äòhow-to‚Äù is
explained with great details in the links

1. [Microsoft excel](https://themaykin.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-van-westendorp-how-to-graph-it-in-excel)
2. [Conjointl](http://conjointly.com/products/van-westendorp/)y (needs-signup)

A sample graph would look like this :

![Untitled](Van%20Westendorp%20pricing%20(Price%20Sensitivity%20Meter)%2029b71dd4501b42d29d7ebcd4ef89f27f/Untitled.png)

**X-axis**: shows all monetary values |**Y-axis**: shows the percentage of respondents

**PMC**- Point of Marginal Cheapness

The left-most intersection (Too cheap and Expensive) is the lower bound of the acceptable price range

**PME**- Point of Marginal Expensiveness

The right-most the intersection (Cheap and Too expensive) defines the upper bound of the range

**Optimum price -**The bottom intersection of*Too cheap*and*Too expensive*defines as % of respondents think price as
either*Too expensive or Too cheap*

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_gray.svg" width="40px" /> PMC ‚â§ Acceptable Price range ‚â§ PME

</aside>

This would be an apt price range i.e $537.76 to $601.53

One may argue to have ‚ÄúOptimum price‚Äù  *** *as its exact price ; yet too risky to bring perfection in real world ; this
might be a very subjective call to take

### Graph Evaluation

- ~25% respondents perceive**$**420 is*too cheap*
- Post**$**410, respondents think, its getting*expensive*
- ~52% respondents perceive its still*cheap at*$453.40
- At $520.52 , ~50% respondents thinks its expensive, ~18% respondents think its cheap

### Conclusion

> PMC ‚â§ Acceptable Price range ‚â§ PME
>

The**Acceptable Price range**price ranges from**$453.40 - $520.52**

One may argue to pin ‚Äú**Optimum price**‚Äù should be price one should sell for i.e**$487.57**; yet little risky to bring
perfection into real world; though this maybe a subjective call.

## Step 4: Additional Analysis (Optional)

The analysis only identifies the price range customers are willing to pay, but not whether they will pay.

- *At a price between the price you identified as ‚Äòa**cheap**‚Äô and the price you said was ‚Äò**getting expensive‚Äô,**how
  likely would you be to purchase?*

1. Very unlikely
2. Unlikely
3. Unsure
4. Likely
5. Very Likely

With this question, assigning an arbitrary value for varying options, one could collect results and take an informed
call on how likelihood expected percentage of purchase is going to be
