# Bug-Free Focus: Brain Hacks for Peak Engineering Performance  
<!-- more -->  
Working day and night, facing tight deadlines, enduring hours of meetings, and trying to catch up on tasks—yet finding no motivation to wrap things up? Oh boy... Been there a gazillion times  
  
 I vividly recall moments when I lost my focus after 60-90 minutes of work and felt like "I am done for the day," not because the work was finished, but because my ability to focus was waning. Internet recommendation was to regain focus was by taking intermittent breaks every 45-90 minutes of work. I gave it a try ! And it **didn’t work** at all …  
  
Here’s what worked well for me ...
  
------------
  
- **Freezing** water showers  
- Drop ice cubes on you’re back while sitting straight and press back against the chair  
- [Foot Fires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHVaTemJUZs&ab_channel=cultfitOfficial)  x  4 Reps; each 45 seconds  
- Change work places often (Bean bag, Gallery, Dining table)  
- Quick outdoor brisk walk or run, 15 minutes is all it takes — Need to sweat for this

I think breaks are great, though what makes complete is **Physical activity during intermittent breaks**
