# Understanding the mischievous `defer()` statement in Go
<!-- more -->

# Basics

> **`defer`** - put off (an action or event) to a later time; postpone.
> 

In Go, the **`defer`** statement is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a program's execution. The deferred function calls are executed in Last In, First Out (LIFO) order just before the main function returns.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("This will be executed last")
    fmt.Println("This will be executed 1st")
}

/*
This will be executed 1st
This will be executed last
*/
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	/*
			How to make coffee ?
			With defer execution is in reverse order
			Last In, First Out
	*/
	defer fmt.Println("Heat Milk")
	defer fmt.Println("Add 1.5 x sugar spoons")
	defer fmt.Println("Add Coffee Power")
	defer fmt.Println("Stir very well, Coffee is ready")

}

/*
Stir very well, Coffee is ready
Add Coffee Power
Add 1.5 x sugar spoons
Heat Milk
*/
```

The above one is classic Example of Last In First Out — [LIFO](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lifo-last-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/)

Lets take an example of career growth and career downfall using defer function

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	getInternship()
}

// Internship function signifies the start of a tech career
func getInternship() {
	fmt.Println("Got the Internship")
	defer fmt.Println("[Defer Function] Career is Doomed")
	defer fmt.Println("[Defer Function] Setback from Internship")
	promoteToSoftwareEngineer()
}

// Handle promotion to Software Engineer role
func promoteToSoftwareEngineer() {
	fmt.Println("Promoted to Software Engineer")

	defer fmt.Println("[Defer Function] Setback from Software Engineer")
	promoteToLeadEngineer()
}

// Function to handle promotion to Lead Engineer
func promoteToLeadEngineer() {
	fmt.Println("Promoted to Lead Engineer")
	defer fmt.Println("[Defer Function] Setback from Lead Engineer")
	promoteToEngineeringManager()
}

// Function to handle promotion to Engineering Manager
func promoteToEngineeringManager() {
	fmt.Println("Promoted to Engineering Manager")
	defer fmt.Println("[Defer Function] Setback from Engineering Manager")
}
```

`Phase 1`

 When surrounding function are finished executing, **`defer`** functions are stored in the  stack 

---

`Phase 2`

 When multiple functions are executed, **`defer`** stack waiting to be pop’ed ;

```go
/*

Promoted to Software Engineer

# Defer read and assign

```go
package main

func main() {
 fmt.Println(whatIsIt())
}

func whatIsIt() (i int) {
 defer func() {
  i++
 }()

 return i
}
```

1. The initial value of**`i`**is**`0`**
2. **`defer`**statement: The**`defer`**keyword in Go postpones the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. In this case, the deferred function is an anonymous function that increments**`i`**by**`1`**.
3. **`return i`**: This statement returns the value of**`i`**. However, because of the**`defer`**statement, the increment operation**`i++`**is executed before the function actually returns.

So, when you run this program, the**`whatIsIt`**function will return**`1`**, not**`0`**, because the deferred function increments**`i`**before the function returns. Therefore, the output of the program will be**`1`**. This is a demonstration of how**`defer`**can modify the return value of a function in Go.

# Defer with Arguments

A deferred function’s arguments are evaluated when the defer statement is evaluated

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int

	defer fmt.Printf("defer call, i: %d", i)

	i++

	fmt.Printf("value of i: %d\n", i)
	return
}

/*
value of i: 1
defer call, i: 0
*/
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var number int
func count() int {
	number++
	return number
}

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("defer count", count())
	fmt.Println("current count", count())
}

/*
current count 2
defer count 1
*/
```

1. The argument to the **`defer`** function is evaluated immediately. So,**`count()`**is actually called here first, incrementing**`i`**to 1

1. **`fmt.Println("current count:", count())`**: This line calls the**`count`**function again, incrementing**`i`**to 2

ie : A deferred function’s arguments are evaluated when the defer statement is evaluated

1. On **`defer`**statement encounter,**`count()`**is called,**`number`**is incremented to**`1`**. This call to**`fmt.Println`**is deferred, meaning it won’t actually be executed until**`main()`**is about to return
2. **`fmt.Println("current count", count())`**is executed. Again,**`count()`**is called,**`number`**is incremented to**`2`**, and**`2`**is passed to**`fmt.Println`**

Finally, when**`main()`**is about to return, the deferred**`fmt.Println`**is executed. However, because the arguments were evaluated at the time of the**`defer`**statement, 

it prints**`defer count 1`**, not**`defer count 2`**.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var number int

func count() int {
	number++
	return number
}

func main() {
	defer printCount()
	fmt.Println("current count:", count())
}

func printCount() {
	fmt.Println("defer count:", count())
}

/*

current count: 1
defer count: 2

*/
```

1. **`defer printCount()`**: The**`defer`**keyword in Go postpones the execution of the function**`printCount()`**until the surrounding function (in this case,**`main`**) returns. This meanswill be the last function to execute in
    
    **`fmt.Println("current count:", count())`**
    
    This line prints the string “current count:” followed by the current value of**`number`**, returned by**`count()`**function
    

1. **`func printCount()`**: This function prints the string “count:” followed by the current value of**`number`**, which is returned by the**`count()`**function

So, it will first print the current count (which will be 1, as**`defer count()`**is called for the first time). Then, just before the**`main`**function finishes execution, it will print the count again (which will be 2, asis called again in**`printCount()`**due to the**`defer`**statement).

# Panic during Defer

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	startGame()
}

// startGame function execution
func startGame() {
	fmt.Println("Lets the games begin... ")
	defer fmt.Println("Discussed wtih Carolina Marin")

	fmt.Println("Carolina Marin about to scream")

	defer fmt.Println("Umpire pauses the game")
	panic("Umpire gives RED card")
}

/*

Lets the games begin... 
Carolina Marin about to scream
Umpire pauses the game
Discussed wtih Carolina Marin
panic: Umpire gives RED card

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.startGame()
        /Users/mrv/go/src/github.com/miravtmehta/zip/main.go:25 +0x12
main.main()
        /Users/mrv/go/src/github.com/miravtmehta/zip/main.go:7 +0xf

*/
```

- The main() function, which is the entry point of a Go executable program, calls the `startGame()` function.
- `The startGame()` function prints several messages:
    1. Initially, the message "`Lets the games begin...`" is printed.
    2. Above '`defer`' keyword is used, which ensures that a function call is performed later in a program's execution. Here, defer `fmt.Println("Discussed wtih Carolina Marin")` defers execution of that line until the surrounding function (`startGame()`) returns, meaning this will be printed out last, before the function ends.
    3. Then it prints `"Carolina Marin about to scream"`
    4. Another '`defer`' is used to print `"Umpire pauses the game"` before the function ends but after `"Discussed wtih Carolina Marin"` because defers are executed in Last In First Out (LIFO) order

After all these, `panic("Umpire gives RED card") is called`. The panic function in Go is used to abort if a function returns an error which we don't want to handle. The panic causes the program to exit with a message. The deferred function calls (outputs in this case) prior to panic are executed before the program exits.

---

```go
Lets the games begin... 
Carolina Marin about to scream
Umpire pauses the game
Discussed wtih Carolina Marin
panic: Umpire gives RED card
```

The order in which elements are printed after the panic statement is due to how the Go defer mechanism works. It behaves as a Last In First Out (LIFO) stack, which means that the last function that was deferred is the first one to be executed at the end or at a panic.

Order of stack print messages:

> main.go  —> defer —> panic
> 

Order of execution:

> main.go —> panic —> defer
> 

defer gets evaluated line-by-line, yet it does not get executed until panic or main exists

## Using recover() to handle Panic

In order to prevent exiting the programme from panic occur, Go has in-build function called `[recover](https://gobyexample.com/recover)`

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_gray.svg" width="40px" /> `recover`must be called within a deferred function, During normal exec, a call to recover will return nil and have no other effect.

</aside>

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer func() {
			if r := recover(); r != nil {
				fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
		}
	}()

	panic("Something went wrong!")
}

/*

Recovered from panic: Something went wrong!

*/
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	startGame()
}

// startGame function execution
func startGame() {
	fmt.Println("Lets the games begin... ")

	fmt.Println("Carolina Marin about to scream")

	defer fmt.Println("Game discontinues ")

	// Deferring the recovery from panic
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
		}
	}()

	panic("Carolina Marin gets Injured")
}

/*

Lets the games begin... 
Carolina Marin about to scream
Recovered from panic: Carolina Marin gets Injured
Game discontinues

*/
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    performRitual()
    fmt.Println("Returned normally from performRitual.")
}

func performRitual() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered in performRitual", r)
        }
    }()
    fmt.Println("Summoning spirits.")
    summonSpecter(0)
    fmt.Println("Returned normally from summonSpecter.")
}

func summonSpecter(i int) {
    if i > 3 {
        fmt.Println("Oops! The specter got out of control and is panicking!")
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("%v", i))
    }
    defer fmt.Println("Defer in summonSpecter", i)
    fmt.Println("Conjuring specter", i)
    summonSpecter(i + 1)
}

/*

# Conclusion

1. [Deferred function calls are executed in Last In First Out order after the surrounding function returns](defer()%20function,%20understanding%20the%20mischievous%206f9457b89963427891bf97bd6fabf4fd.md)
2. [A deferred function’s arguments are evaluated when the defer statement is evaluated](defer()%20function,%20understanding%20the%20mischievous%206f9457b89963427891bf97bd6fabf4fd.md)
3. [Deferred functions may read and assign to the returning function’s named return values](defer()%20function,%20understanding%20the%20mischievous%206f9457b89963427891bf97bd6fabf4fd.md)

Understanding the nuances of deferred functions in Go is crucial, and two key pitfalls warrant attention: 

1. **argument evaluation**
2. **order of execution**. 

so it's important to be mindful of how arguments are evaluated when deferring functions and the LIFO (Last In, First Out) order in which deferred functions are executed.
